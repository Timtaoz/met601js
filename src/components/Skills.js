      <h2>My Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout this course, I have gained proficiency in several key web development technologies. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Structuring web content in a semantic and accessible manner.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> Styling and laying out web pages with modern techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Creating interactive and dynamic web experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>React:</strong> Building component-based user interfaces with efficient state management.</li>
      </ul>

        These skills have enabled me to develop comprehensive and responsive web applications, and I am excited to continue building on this foundation.
